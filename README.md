# OS-Job Scheduling Algorithms Visualization

A desktop application to visualize os job/process scheduling algorithm. 

Algorithms:
* First Come First Serve (FCFS)
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
* Round Robin (RR)
* Longest Job First (LJF)
* Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
* Priority Based Scheduling
